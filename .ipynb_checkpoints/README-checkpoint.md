## Analysis of candidates in 2019 General Election in the Republic of India.
## Prediction of a candidate winning the election based on his/her features using Logistic Regression Classification.
## With over 600 Million voters voting for 8500+ candidates across 543 constituencies, the general elections in the world's largest democracy are a potential goldmine of data. 
### While there are existing separate analysis about the votes each candidate received and the personal information of each candidate, there was no comprehensive analysis that included both these information.
